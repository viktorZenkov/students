Hi, I'm Syd Shelby; I'm a third year student studying Computer Science. I have field experience as a Software Engineering Intern at JTV and as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at CURENT. I'm interested in Artifical Intelligence/Machine Learning, Software Engineering, and Computational Social Science.
